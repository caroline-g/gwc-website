      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a high school sophomore from Oregon who loves learning about
        anything and everything. As a member of the Girls Who Code Summer
        Immersion Program, I've developed this website to help highlight some of
        my interests, projects, and achievements. In addition to international
        politics, cultural dialogue, creative writing, music, and social
        entrepreneurship, I love learning languages (focused on French, Korean,
        and Chinese right now), crocheting, drawing, and obsessing over anime
        and K-pop.
      </p>

      <h2>Writer</h2>
      <p>
        I've been scribbling down stories of unicorns and talking dogs since
        second grade, and creative writing remains one of my strongest passions
        and outlets in life. My work is focused on short stories, creative
        nonfiction, and young adult, but I'm also starting my first novel and
        love exploring different genres.
      </p>
      <h2>Aspiring Politician</h2>
      <p>
        I've always believed in the power of public policy and political
        leadership to change society for good. Through my involvement in Youth
        and Government, speech and debate, class council, and local political
        campaigns, I hope to set up a strong foundation for a career in
        diplomacy and/or domestic politics!
      </p>
      <h2>Flutist</h2>
      <p>
        I started playing flute in 5th grade band and haven't stopped since! In
        addition to school band, local orchestras, and honors ensembles, I enjoy
        performing in solo competitions and teaching private lessons.
      </p>
      <h2>Researcher</h2>
      <p>
        As a research intern in Dr. Margaret Burnett's lab at Oregon State
        University, I helped co-author several papers on how socioeconomic
        status, gender, and various other sociological factors can affect
        technology use. Through working with GenderMag, explainable AI, and
        human-computer interaction, we aim to reduce cognitive biases in
        existing software and make software intuitive and user-friendly for all
        people.
