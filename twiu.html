        I'm in the process of founding a youth organization called The World in
        Us (TWIU). TWIU seeks to eliminate cultural ignorance from its roots
        through youth-for-youth education: we provide a platform for high school
        and college students to research, prepare, and teach introductory
        curriculum on global cultures to elementary-aged students. I'm always
        looking for potential collaborators and mentors! If anyone wants to get
        involed (helping with curriculum development, leadership positions,
        marketing/social media, providing your own cultural
        persepctive/critiques on our lessons), please do get in touch! I'd also
        love to hear from you if you have experience with youth organizations or
        know someone with relevant experience/knowledge who would like to help a
        budding youth organization grow.
