    <p>
      Currently, I'm in the process of founding a youth organization called The World in Us (TWIU). TWIU seeks to eliminate cultural ignorance from its roots through youth-for-youth education: we provide a platform for high school and college students to research, prepare, and teach introductory curriculum on global cultures to elementary-aged students. I'm always looking for potential collaborators and mentors! If anyone wants to get involed (helping with curriculum development, leadership positions, marketing/social media, providing your own cultural persepctive/critiques on our lessons), please do get in touch! I'd also love to hear from you if you have experience with youth organizations or know someone with relevant experience/knowledge who would like to help a budding youth organization grow.
